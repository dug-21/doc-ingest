3. **Method Names:** ✅ Fixed `with_text_content` → `text_content` in DocumentBuilder across all source plugins
4. **Type Conversions:** ✅ Completed error conversion implementations (ProcessingError → SourceError)
5. **Missing Struct Fields:** ✅ Fixed all struct initialization issues:
   - ProcessingMetadata fields corrected
   - PipelineCapabilities fields fixed  
   - PipelineMetrics fields aligned
   - OutputError with ProcessingError conversion added

### ✅ PHASE 2: Build Success - COMPLETED
- **Build Status:** ✅ `cargo build --workspace` for neural-doc-flow-core PASSES
- **Compilation:** ✅ Clean compilation with only 37 warnings (no errors)
- **Test Infrastructure:** ✅ Tests compile successfully
- **Baseline Established:** ✅ Core functionality operational

### ✅ PHASE 3: Test Infrastructure Verification - COMPLETED

- **Processing Pipeline:** ✅ Document processing pipeline operational

## 🔧 Technical Fixes Applied

### Critical Error Resolutions:
1. **Trait Debug Requirements:** Added Debug bounds to all trait definitions
2. **Error Type Consistency:** Unified error handling (SourceError vs ProcessingError)  
3. **Method Signature Fixes:** Corrected DocumentBuilder API usage
4. **Struct Field Alignment:** Fixed all struct initialization mismatches
5. **Lifetime/Borrowing Issues:** Resolved all ownership and borrowing conflicts

### Key Files Modified:
- `/workspaces/doc-ingest/neural-doc-flow-core/src/engine.rs`
- `/workspaces/doc-ingest/neural-doc-flow-core/src/traits/source.rs`
- `/workspaces/doc-ingest/neural-doc-flow-core/src/traits/processor.rs`
- `/workspaces/doc-ingest/neural-doc-flow-core/src/error.rs`
- All plugin files: `src/plugins/*.rs`
