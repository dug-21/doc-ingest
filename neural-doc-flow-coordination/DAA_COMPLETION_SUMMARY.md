## Architecture Alignment with Iteration 5 DAA

The implementation fully aligns with the DAA coordination requirements:

1. **Distributed Agent Architecture**: Each agent is self-contained with its own message queue and processing logic
2. **Fault Tolerance**: Multiple layers including circuit breakers, retry policies, and failover management
3. **Message Passing**: Priority-based message routing with multiple protocols
4. **Resource Management**: Dynamic resource allocation and monitoring
5. **Scalability**: Support for multiple routing strategies and dynamic agent spawning

## Key Features Implemented

- **Agent Framework**: Extensible base trait with common functionality
- **Message Bus**: Full-featured with priority queuing and fault tolerance
- **Routing Engine**: Intelligent message routing based on capabilities and load
- **Resource Pool**: Dynamic resource allocation with monitoring
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous health checks with automatic recovery
- **Protocol Support**: Multiple communication patterns for different use cases

## Testing Recommendations

1. Unit tests for each agent type
2. Integration tests for message routing
3. Fault injection tests for circuit breakers
4. Performance tests for resource allocation
5. End-to-end tests for full coordination flow

The DAA implementation is now complete and ready for integration with the neural document processing system.
