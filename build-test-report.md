# Build Test Report

## Summary

The workspace build is **FAILING** due to multiple compilation errors across different crates. The primary blocker is a dependency conflict in the `candle-core` crate (a transitive dependency).

## Build Results by Package

### ✅ Successfully Building
1. **neural-doc-flow-core** - Builds with 1 warning (unused field)
2. **neural-doc-flow-coordination** - Builds with 41 warnings (mostly unused imports/fields)
3. **neural-doc-flow-processors** - Builds with 3 warnings (unused fields)

### ❌ Failed to Build
1. **candle-core** (v0.3.3) - **CRITICAL BLOCKER**
   - Multiple versions of `rand` crate in dependency tree causing trait conflicts
   - Error: `half::bf16: SampleBorrow<half::bf16>` trait bound not satisfied
   - This is blocking the entire workspace build

2. **neural-doc-flow-sources** - Multiple errors:
   - Missing import: `lopdf` crate not properly imported
   - Method not in trait: `process` is not a member of `DocumentSource` trait
   - Type mismatches: Using undefined types like `DocumentSourceType`, `DocumentType`
   - Field access errors: Trying to access non-existent fields on `Document` struct
   - 17 compilation errors total

3. **neural-doc-flow-outputs** - Multiple errors:
   - Field access errors: Accessing non-existent fields like `doc_type`, `source_type`, `raw_content`, `structure`, `attachments`
   - Missing trait implementations: `DocumentOutput` doesn't implement `Debug`
   - 78 compilation errors total

## Error Categories

### 1. Dependency Conflicts (Critical)
```rust
error[E0277]: the trait bound `half::bf16: SampleBorrow<half::bf16>` is not satisfied
```
- Multiple versions of `rand` crate (0.8.5 and 0.9.1) in dependency tree
- Affecting `candle-core` which is a transitive dependency

### 2. API Mismatches
- `Document` struct is missing expected fields:
  - `doc_type`
  - `source_type` 
  - `raw_content`
  - `structure`
  - `attachments`
- Methods not matching trait definitions

### 3. Type/Import Issues
- Undefined types: `DocumentSourceType`, `DocumentType`
- Missing imports: `lopdf`
- Wrong method signatures in trait implementations

## Prioritized Fix List

### Priority 1: Critical Blockers
1. **Fix candle-core dependency conflict**
   - Update Cargo.toml to force single version of `rand`
   - Consider updating or replacing `candle-core` dependency
   - May need to use cargo patch or override

### Priority 2: API Alignment
2. **Fix Document struct field mismatches**
   - Either add missing fields to core `Document` struct
   - OR update sources/outputs to use correct field names
   - Review and align with neural-doc-flow-core API

3. **Fix trait implementations**
   - Ensure `DocumentSource` trait has `process` method
   - Add missing trait implementations (`Debug` for `DocumentOutput`)

### Priority 3: Type Definitions
4. **Add missing type definitions**
   - Define `DocumentSourceType` enum
   - Define `DocumentType` enum
   - Ensure all imports are correct

### Priority 4: Warnings
5. **Clean up warnings** (41 total in coordination module)
   - Remove unused imports
   - Add `#[allow(dead_code)]` or remove unused fields
   - Fix unused variables

## Test Suite Status

Found test files in:
- neural-doc-flow-outputs/tests/
- neural-doc-flow-processors/tests/
- neural-doc-flow-sources/tests/
- neural-doc-flow-core/tests/
- neural-doc-flow-coordination/tests/
- tests/ (root level)

**Cannot run tests** until compilation errors are fixed.

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Action**: Fix the `candle-core` dependency conflict by adding to root Cargo.toml:
   ```toml
   [patch.crates-io]
   rand = { version = "0.8.5" }
   ```

2. **API Review**: The Document struct in core needs to match what sources/outputs expect

3. **Consider**: Building without the problematic crates temporarily:
   ```bash
   cargo build --workspace --exclude neural-doc-flow-sources --exclude neural-doc-flow-outputs
   ```

## Build Commands Used

- `cargo build` - Full workspace build (FAILED)
- `cargo build --lib` - Library-only build (FAILED)
- `cargo build -p [package]` - Individual package builds
- `cargo test --lib` - Library tests (BLOCKED by build failures)
