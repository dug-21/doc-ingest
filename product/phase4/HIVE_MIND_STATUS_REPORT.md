## 🚨 Current Blockers

### High Priority (Blocking Phase 2)
1. **Remaining Compilation Errors** (~40-50 remaining)
   - Trait definition mismatches
   - Import resolution issues
   - Type consistency problems

2. **ruv_fann Integration** (Partially resolved)
   - API compatibility issues
   - Alternative solution implemented
   - May need complete replacement

### Medium Priority
1. **Test Implementation** (Infrastructure ready)
   - Need to write actual test cases
   - Coverage measurement blocked by compilation

2. **Documentation Gaps**
   - API documentation incomplete
   - Plugin development guide needed

## 🎯 Phase 2 Readiness Assessment

### Ready for Phase 2: 7/10
- ✅ Test infrastructure in place
- ✅ Major compilation blockers resolved
- ✅ Neural alternative solution available
- ✅ Security assessment complete
- ⚠️ Still need clean compilation
- ⚠️ Need dependency resolution finalized

## 📅 Updated Timeline

### Phase 1 Completion (Days 1-4)
- **Day 1-2**: ✅ COMPLETE - Major fixes applied
- **Day 3**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS - Final compilation cleanup
- **Day 4**: ⏳ PLANNED - Build validation & Phase 2 prep

### Phase 2: Core Functionality (Days 5-11)
- **Days 5-6**: Document processing pipeline implementation
- **Days 7-8**: Neural network integration completion
- **Days 9-11**: API endpoint implementation

### Phase 3: Test Coverage (Days 12-18)
- **Days 12-14**: API module tests (0% → 60%)
- **Days 15-16**: Integration tests
- **Days 17-18**: Coverage gap analysis

### Phase 4: Production Hardening (Days 19-21)
- **Day 19**: Performance optimization
- **Day 20**: Security hardening
- **Day 21**: Documentation & deployment

## 🔮 Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ✅
- Test infrastructure (ready to implement)
- Basic compilation fixes (mostly resolved)
- Agent coordination (working well)

### Medium Risk ⚠️
- Neural network integration (alternative solution available)
- Dependency management (mostly resolved)
- API implementation (straightforward)

### High Risk 🚨
- Remaining compilation errors (complex trait issues)
- Test coverage timeline (dependent on compilation)
- Production security hardening (needs focused attention)

## 📋 Next 24 Hours Priority Actions

1. **Complete compilation cleanup** (Rust Core Dev)
2. **Finalize ruv_fann integration** (Neural Dev)
3. **Begin Phase 2 planning** (Phase4 Lead)
4. **Validate test execution** (Test Engineer)
