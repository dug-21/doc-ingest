  - URL counting
  - Obfuscation scoring
- Placeholder for neural network integration

#### 3. **Sandboxing Framework (Linux)**
- **Namespace Isolation**: PID, NET, MNT, UTS, IPC namespaces

- JavaScript-specific threat analysis
- Threat categorization system

### ❌ Unimplemented/Incomplete Features

#### 1. **Neural Network Models**
- **Status**: Scaffolding exists but no actual neural network implementation
- **Missing**:
  - Model training pipeline
  - Model serialization/deserialization
  - Actual neural network inference
  - Model validation and metrics calculation
- **TODO Comments**: 
  - `base.rs:229`: Calculate actual error when MSE is available
  - `base.rs:230`: Implement proper convergence check
  - `base.rs:308`: Implement proper save using ruv_fann I/O
  - `base.rs:314`: Implement proper load using ruv_fann I/O

#### 2. **Advanced Sandboxing Features**
- **Chroot Implementation**: Disabled due to missing nix features
- **Seccomp Filters**: Basic implementation, needs proper BPF program
- **User Namespaces**: Disabled (requires special setup)
- **Non-Linux Support**: Limited fallback implementation

#### 3. **Security Validation**
- No input validation for document content
- Missing bounds checking in feature extraction
- No rate limiting or DoS protection
- Insufficient error handling in critical paths

#### 4. **Cryptographic Security**
- No document signature verification
- Missing encryption for sensitive data
- No secure key management
- Audit logs stored in plaintext

## Critical Security Gaps

### 1. **High Priority - Production Blockers**

#### A. **Neural Network Integration**
- **Risk**: Current heuristic detection has high false positive/negative rates
- **Impact**: Malware could bypass detection
- **Recommendation**: Implement actual neural networks or use proven ML libraries

#### B. **Input Validation**
- **Risk**: Buffer overflows, injection attacks, DoS
- **Impact**: System compromise, data corruption
- **Recommendation**: Implement comprehensive input validation and sanitization

#### C. **Seccomp Hardening**
- **Risk**: Sandboxed processes can make dangerous system calls
- **Impact**: Sandbox escape, privilege escalation
- **Recommendation**: Implement proper seccomp-bpf filters

### 2. **Medium Priority - Security Enhancements**

#### A. **Cryptographic Controls**
- Implement document signing and verification
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Use secure communication channels
- Implement key rotation

#### B. **Advanced Threat Detection**
- Implement behavioral analysis beyond heuristics
- Add zero-day detection capabilities
- Integrate with threat intelligence feeds
- Implement machine learning model updates

#### C. **Audit Enhancements**
- Implement tamper-proof logging
- Add log aggregation and SIEM integration
- Implement real-time alerting
- Add compliance reporting features

### 3. **Low Priority - Nice to Have**

#### A. **Cross-Platform Sandboxing**
- Improve non-Linux sandbox capabilities
- Add Windows and macOS specific security features
- Implement container-based isolation options

#### B. **Performance Optimizations**
- SIMD acceleration for security operations
- Parallel threat analysis
- Caching for repeated scans

## Risk Assessment

### Critical Risks
1. **Malware Detection Ineffective**: Without trained neural networks, detection relies on basic heuristics
2. **Sandbox Escape Possible**: Incomplete seccomp implementation leaves attack surface
3. **Input Validation Missing**: No protection against malformed documents
4. **Audit Log Tampering**: Logs stored in plaintext without integrity protection

### Implementation Priorities for Phase 4

1. **Implement Neural Network Models**
   - Train malware detection model with real dataset
   - Implement model serialization and loading
   - Add continuous learning capabilities
   - Target >99.5% accuracy as specified

2. **Harden Sandboxing**
   - Complete seccomp-bpf implementation
   - Add ptrace restrictions
   - Implement network filtering
   - Add filesystem quotas

3. **Add Input Validation**
   - Validate all document inputs
   - Implement size limits
   - Add format verification
   - Sanitize metadata

4. **Enhance Audit Security**
   - Implement cryptographic signing of logs
   - Add remote secure logging
   - Implement log rotation and archival
   - Add compliance reporting

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Phase 2 Completion)
1. Replace placeholder neural network code with actual implementation
2. Complete seccomp filter implementation
3. Add comprehensive input validation
4. Implement basic cryptographic controls

### Phase 4 Priorities
1. Train and deploy production-ready neural models
2. Implement advanced threat detection features
3. Add compliance and regulatory features
4. Enhance cross-platform support

### Security Testing Requirements
1. Penetration testing of sandbox implementation
2. Fuzzing of document parsers
3. Neural network adversarial testing
4. Performance testing under attack conditions

## Conclusion

The security module provides a solid architectural foundation but lacks critical implementation details necessary for production deployment. The most significant gap is the absence of actual neural network implementation, which undermines the system's primary security value proposition. Phase 4 must prioritize completing these implementations to achieve the advertised security capabilities.
