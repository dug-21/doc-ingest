# Phase 2: Swarm Coordination - Multi-Agent Infrastructure

## üéØ Overall Objective
Build a distributed multi-agent system that enables parallel document processing at scale. This phase introduces swarm intelligence to coordinate multiple processing agents, achieving 10-15x performance improvements through intelligent work distribution, fault tolerance, and dynamic scaling capabilities.

## üìã Detailed Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Agent Management System**
   - Spawn/terminate agents dynamically based on workload
   - Agent health monitoring and heartbeat system
   - Automatic agent recovery on failure
   - Agent capability registration and discovery
   - Resource allocation and load balancing

2. **Task Distribution Engine**
   - Intelligent document chunking strategies
   - Work queue management with priorities
   - Task dependency resolution
   - Result aggregation and merge strategies
   - Progress tracking and reporting

3. **Communication Infrastructure**
   - High-performance message passing between agents
   - Shared memory coordination for local agents
   - Network communication for distributed agents
   - Event-driven architecture with pub/sub
   - Backpressure handling

4. **Coordination Patterns**
   - MapReduce for document processing
   - Pipeline patterns for multi-stage processing
   - Scatter-gather for parallel extraction
   - Leader election for coordinator agents

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Throughput**: 1000+ pages/second with 8 agents
- **Scalability**: Linear scaling up to 64 agents
- **Latency**: <10ms coordination overhead per task
- **Fault Tolerance**: Automatic recovery within 5 seconds
- **Resource Efficiency**: >80% CPU utilization across agents

### Technical Specifications
```rust
// Core Swarm API
pub trait SwarmCoordinator {
    fn initialize(config: SwarmConfig) -> Result<Self>;
    fn spawn_agent(&mut self, agent_type: AgentType) -> Result<AgentId>;
    fn submit_task(&mut self, task: Task) -> Result<TaskId>;
    fn get_status(&self) -> SwarmStatus;
    fn shutdown(&mut self) -> Result<()>;
}

pub struct Agent {
    pub id: AgentId,
    pub capabilities: Vec<Capability>,
    pub status: AgentStatus,
    pub workload: Workload,
}

pub trait Task: Send + Sync {
    fn execute(&self, context: &AgentContext) -> Result<TaskResult>;
    fn can_split(&self) -> bool;
    fn split(&self) -> Vec<Box<dyn Task>>;
    fn merge_results(results: Vec<TaskResult>) -> Result<TaskResult>;
}
```

- 16 agents: 1200+ pages/second (75% efficiency)
- Coordination overhead: <10ms per task
```

## üîó Integration with Other Components

### Uses from Phase 1 (Core Foundation)
```rust

impl ChunkableDocument for PdfDocument {
    fn chunk_by_pages(&self, chunk_size: usize) -> Vec<DocumentChunk>;
    fn merge_results(chunks: Vec<ProcessedChunk>) -> ProcessedDocument;
}
```

### Provides to Phase 3 (Neural Engine)
```rust
// Distributed processing interface
pub trait DistributedProcessor {
    fn process_distributed<T: Task>(&self, task: T) -> Result<TaskResult>;
    fn map_reduce<M, R>(&self, mapper: M, reducer: R) -> Result<R::Output>;
}
```

### Enables Phase 4 (Document Intelligence)

### Technical Risks
1. **Distributed System Complexity** (High probability, High impact)
   - Mitigation: Start with local-only mode, proven algorithms
   - Fallback: Simplified master-worker pattern initially

2. **Performance Overhead** (Medium probability, High impact)
   - Mitigation: Extensive profiling, zero-copy design
   - Fallback: Reduce coordination frequency

3. **Deadlock/Starvation** (Medium probability, Medium impact)
   - Mitigation: Formal verification, timeout mechanisms
   - Fallback: Conservative scheduling algorithms

### Operational Risks
1. **Resource Contention** (High probability, Medium impact)
   - Mitigation: Resource isolation, cgroup limits
   - Fallback: Static resource allocation
