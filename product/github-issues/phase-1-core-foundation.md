# Phase 1: Core Foundation - Basic Rust PDF Processing

## üéØ Overall Objective
Establish the foundational Rust-based PDF processing engine that serves as the bedrock for all subsequent neural and parallel processing enhancements. This phase creates a high-performance, memory-safe PDF parsing library that outperforms existing solutions by 2-4x while providing clean interfaces for future phases.

## üìã Detailed Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **PDF Parsing Engine**
   - Support for PDF 1.0-2.0 specifications
   - Handle encrypted PDFs (40-bit, 128-bit, 256-bit AES)
   - Extract text with positional information
   - Parse document structure (pages, sections, metadata)
   - Support for compressed streams (FlateDecode, LZWDecode, etc.)

2. **Text Extraction Pipeline**
   - Unicode text extraction with proper encoding handling
   - Font mapping and character recognition
   - Layout preservation with bounding box coordinates
   - Whitespace and formatting detection
   - Support for RTL and vertical text

3. **Page Processing**
   - Individual page extraction without loading entire document
   - Streaming API for large documents
   - Page rotation and transformation handling
   - Content stream parsing and interpretation

4. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful degradation for malformed PDFs
   - Detailed error reporting with recovery strategies
   - Partial extraction on corrupted documents

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Process 90+ pages/second on modern hardware
- **Memory**: <100MB RAM for 1000-page documents
- **Reliability**: 99.5% success rate on real-world PDFs
- **Safety**: Zero unsafe blocks in public API
- **Compatibility**: Works with 95%+ of PDFs in the wild

### Technical Specifications
```rust
// Core API Design
pub trait PdfProcessor {
    fn open(path: &Path) -> Result<Self>;
    fn page_count(&self) -> usize;
    fn extract_page(&self, page_num: usize) -> Result<Page>;
    fn extract_text(&self) -> Result<String>;
    fn metadata(&self) -> Result<Metadata>;
}

pub struct Page {
    pub number: usize,
    pub width: f32,
    pub height: f32,
    pub text_blocks: Vec<TextBlock>,
    pub raw_content: Vec<u8>,
}

pub struct TextBlock {
    pub text: String,
    pub bbox: BoundingBox,
    pub font: FontInfo,
    pub style: TextStyle,
}
```

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

### Functional Success Metrics
1. **Parsing Success Rate**: ‚â•99.5% on test corpus of 10,000 PDFs
2. **Text Extraction Accuracy**: ‚â•99% character accuracy vs ground truth
3. **Memory Usage**: <100MB for 1000-page documents
4. **Processing Speed**: ‚â•90 pages/second single-threaded
5. **API Completeness**: 100% of core PDF features supported

### Performance Benchmarks
```bash
# Benchmark suite must show:
- Small PDFs (1-10 pages): <50ms total processing
- Medium PDFs (10-100 pages): <500ms total processing  
- Large PDFs (100-1000 pages): <5 seconds total processing
- Memory growth: Linear with document size, not exponential
```

- [ ] All unit tests passing (>95% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests with 1000+ real PDFs passing
- [ ] Fuzzing for 24 hours with no crashes
- [ ] Performance regression tests passing
- [ ] Memory leak detection clean
- [ ] Documentation complete with examples

## üîó Integration with Other Components

### Provides to Phase 2 (Swarm Coordination)
```rust
// Chunk API for parallel processing
pub trait ChunkableDocument {
    fn chunk_by_pages(&self, chunk_size: usize) -> Vec<DocumentChunk>;
    fn merge_results(chunks: Vec<ProcessedChunk>) -> ProcessedDocument;
}
```

### Provides to Phase 3 (Neural Engine)
```rust
// Feature extraction API
pub trait FeatureExtractor {
    fn extract_features(&self, page: &Page) -> Features;
    fn text_blocks(&self) -> Vec<TextBlock>;
    fn layout_graph(&self) -> LayoutGraph;
}
```

### Foundation for Phase 4 (Document Intelligence)
- Structured text with positioning for NLP models
- Clean document representation for transformer input
- Layout information for visual understanding models

## üöß Risk Factors and Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **PDF Complexity** (High probability, High impact)
   - Mitigation: Use mature PDF library, extensive test corpus
   - Fallback: Implement subset of features, iterate

2. **Performance Requirements** (Medium probability, High impact)
   - Mitigation: Profile early, optimize hot paths, use SIMD
   - Fallback: Relax targets to 50 pages/second initially

3. **Memory Constraints** (Medium probability, Medium impact)
   - Mitigation: Streaming design, lazy loading, memory pools
   - Fallback: Document size limits for v1

### Development Risks
1. **Rust Expertise** (Medium probability, Medium impact)
   - Mitigation: Hire experienced Rust developers, training
   - Fallback: Consultant support, code reviews
