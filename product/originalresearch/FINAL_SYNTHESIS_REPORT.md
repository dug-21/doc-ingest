## 🔮 Beyond PyPDF: Revolutionary Capabilities

### 1. Context-Aware Extraction
Unlike pypdf's blind text extraction, NeuralDocFlow understands:
- Document structure and hierarchy
- Semantic relationships between sections
- Financial statement interconnections
- Temporal patterns in quarterly reports

### 2. Multi-Modal Processing
Process not just text, but:
- **Tables**: Neural extraction with structure preservation
- **Charts**: Visual data extraction and interpretation
- **Images**: Embedded diagram understanding
- **Mixed Content**: Unified processing pipeline

### 3. Intelligent Configuration
Users can configure:
- What to extract (entities, relationships, metrics)
- How to extract (models, confidence thresholds)
- Output format (JSON, XML, databases)
- Processing strategy (speed vs. accuracy)

## 💡 Potential Applications

### 1. SEC Filing Analysis Platform
- Automated extraction of all financial metrics
