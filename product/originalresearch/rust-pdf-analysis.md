    let futures = paths.into_iter()
        .map(|path| tokio::spawn(async move {
            process_single_pdf(path).await
        }));
    
    futures::future::join_all(futures).await
}

// Stream processing for large PDFs
async fn stream_process_pdf(path: PathBuf) -> Result<()> {
    let mut reader = AsyncPdfReader::new(path).await?;
    
    while let Some(page) = reader.next_page().await? {
