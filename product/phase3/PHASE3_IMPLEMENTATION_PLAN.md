## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. Neural Security Models

    model_trainer: ModelTrainer,
    validator: ModelValidator,
    deployment: ModelDeployment,
}

impl SecurityTrainingPipeline {
    pub async fn train_all_models(&self) -> Result<SecurityModels> {
        let models = SecurityModels {
            malware_detector: self.train_malware_model().await?,
            threat_classifier: self.train_threat_classifier().await?,
            anomaly_detector: self.train_anomaly_model().await?,
            behavior_analyzer: self.train_behavior_model().await?,
            exploit_detector: self.train_exploit_model().await?,
        };
        
        self.validate_ensemble(&models).await?;
        Ok(models)
    }
}
```

### 2. Sandbox Implementation

```rust
// Process isolation with Linux namespaces
pub struct ProcessSandbox {
    namespace_config: NamespaceConfig,
    resource_limits: ResourceLimits,
    security_policies: SecurityPolicies,
    audit_logger: Arc<AuditLogger>,
}

impl ProcessSandbox {
    pub fn execute_plugin(&self, plugin: &Plugin, input: &[u8]) -> Result<PluginOutput> {
        let sandbox = self.create_isolated_process()?;
        sandbox.set_resource_limits(&self.resource_limits)?;
        sandbox.apply_security_policies(&self.security_policies)?;
        
        let result = sandbox.run_with_timeout(plugin, input, Duration::from_secs(30))?;
        
        self.audit_logger.log_execution(&plugin.id, &result);
        Ok(result)
    }
}
```

### 3. SIMD Optimizations

```rust
// SIMD-accelerated neural operations
#[cfg(target_arch = "x86_64")]
pub mod simd {
    use std::arch::x86_64::*;
    
    pub unsafe fn neural_forward_pass_avx2(
        weights: &[f32],
        inputs: &[f32],
        outputs: &mut [f32],
    ) {
        // AVX2 implementation for 8x parallel operations
        let chunks = inputs.chunks_exact(8);
        let remainder = chunks.remainder();
        
        for (i, chunk) in chunks.enumerate() {
            let input_vec = _mm256_loadu_ps(chunk.as_ptr());
            let weight_vec = _mm256_loadu_ps(weights[i*8..].as_ptr());
            let result = _mm256_mul_ps(input_vec, weight_vec);
            _mm256_storeu_ps(outputs[i*8..].as_mut_ptr(), result);
        }
        
        // Handle remainder with scalar operations
        scalar_forward_pass(remainder, &weights[chunks.len()*8..], 
                          &mut outputs[chunks.len()*8..]);
    }
}
```

### 4. Plugin Hot-Reload System

```rust
// File watcher for hot-reload
pub struct PluginHotReloader {
    watcher: RecommendedWatcher,
    plugin_paths: HashMap<PathBuf, PluginId>,
    reload_queue: Arc<Mutex<VecDeque<PluginId>>>,
    manager: Arc<PluginManager>,
}

impl PluginHotReloader {
    pub fn start_watching(&mut self) -> Result<()> {
        let reload_queue = self.reload_queue.clone();
        let plugin_paths = self.plugin_paths.clone();
        
        self.watcher.watch(&self.plugin_dir, RecursiveMode::Recursive)?;
        
        tokio::spawn(async move {
            while let Some(plugin_id) = reload_queue.lock().await.pop_front() {
                if let Err(e) = self.reload_plugin(plugin_id).await {
                    error!("Failed to reload plugin {}: {}", plugin_id, e);
                }
            }

## Conclusion

Phase 3 represents the culmination of the neural document processing system development. By focusing on implementation completion, security hardening, and performance optimization, we will deliver a production-ready system that fully realizes the pure Rust architecture vision. The 8-week timeline is aggressive but achievable with proper coordination and the modular architecture established in previous phases.

Success will be measured by concrete metrics, validated through comprehensive testing, and demonstrated through real-world performance benchmarks. The swarm-based development approach, combined with clear success criteria and risk mitigation strategies, positions Phase 3 for successful delivery.
