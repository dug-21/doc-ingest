# Phase 2 Build Summary

## Overview

Phase 2 implementation has successfully created the core components for the enhanced neural document processing system. Building upon the validated Phase 1 architecture, we have implemented security features, plugin system with hot-reload, and laid the foundation for >99% accuracy.

## Components Implemented

### 1. ✅ Security Module (`neural-doc-flow-security`)
- **Malware Detection**: Neural-based threat detection using ruv-FANN
- **Threat Analysis**: Pattern matching and behavioral analysis
- **Plugin Sandboxing**: Process isolation and resource limits
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive security event tracking

Key Features:
- Real-time security scanning (<5ms target)
- Multiple threat categories (JavaScript exploits, embedded executables, etc.)
- Configurable security actions (Allow, Sanitize, Quarantine, Block)
- Integration with core document processing pipeline

### 2. ✅ Enhanced Document Engine (`neural-doc-flow-core/src/engine.rs`)
- **Security Integration**: Pre-scan all documents before processing
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track processing metrics
- **Audit Trail**: Complete processing history
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with security threats

Key Enhancements:
- `process_secure()` method for security-aware processing
- Parallel security analysis using tokio
- Configurable threat thresholds
- Integrated performance metrics

### 3. ✅ Plugin System (`neural-doc-flow-plugins`)
- **Dynamic Loading**: Runtime plugin discovery and loading
- **Hot-Reload**: Automatic plugin updates without restart
- **Security Sandbox**: Each plugin runs in isolated environment
- **Registry Management**: Centralized plugin lifecycle

Key Features:
- File system watcher for automatic reload
- Plugin capability declarations
- Resource limit enforcement
- Version compatibility checking
