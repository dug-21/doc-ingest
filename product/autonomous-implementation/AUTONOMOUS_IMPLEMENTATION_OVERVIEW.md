# Autonomous NeuralDocFlow Implementation Overview

## 🚀 Revolutionary Vision
Transform NeuralDocFlow from a domain-specific document processor into an **autonomous, self-learning system** that can process ANY document type through configuration alone. By integrating DAA (Dynamic Autonomous Agents) and replacing hardcoded specialization with intelligent adaptation, we achieve unlimited domain flexibility while maintaining exceptional performance.

## 🏗️ Autonomous Architecture

### Configuration-Driven Processing
```yaml
# Example: Define what you want, not how to get it
output_schema:
  financial_data:
    revenue: number
    expenses: number
  risk_factors:
    - description: string
      severity: enum[low, medium, high]
  metadata:
    document_date: date
    company_name: string
```

### Autonomous Processing Flow
```
YAML Config → Document Analysis → Model Discovery → Pipeline Construction → Execution → Learning
