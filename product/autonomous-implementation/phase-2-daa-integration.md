# Phase 2: DAA Integration - Dynamic Autonomous Agents

## üéØ Overall Objective
Integrate the DAA (Decentralized Autonomous Agents) framework to enable self-organizing, intelligent agent swarms that can autonomously coordinate document processing tasks. This phase transforms static processing into a dynamic, adaptive system using DAA's MRAP loop (Monitor ‚Üí Reason ‚Üí Act ‚Üí Reflect ‚Üí Adapt).

## üìã Detailed Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **DAA Framework Integration**
   - MRAP loop implementation for continuous improvement
   - Distributed agent orchestration
   - Federated learning capabilities
   - Economic incentive system for agents
   - Quantum-resistant security protocols

2. **Agent Lifecycle Management**
   - Dynamic agent spawning based on workload
   - Capability-based agent selection
   - Health monitoring and self-healing
   - Resource allocation and optimization
   - Graceful shutdown and cleanup

3. **Coordination Protocols**
   - Swarm intelligence for task distribution
   - Consensus mechanisms for decisions
   - Inter-agent communication channels
   - Collective learning protocols
   - Performance-based agent ranking

4. **Adaptive Behavior System**
   - Monitor document characteristics
   - Reason about optimal strategies
   - Act on processing decisions
   - Reflect on outcomes
   - Adapt future behavior

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Autonomy**: Agents operate without human intervention
- **Scalability**: Support 100+ concurrent agents
- **Learning**: Continuous improvement through MRAP
- **Resilience**: Self-healing and fault tolerance
- **Performance**: <50ms coordination overhead

    async fn act(&self, strategy: Strategy) -> ActionResult;
    async fn reflect(&self, result: ActionResult) -> Performance;
    async fn adapt(&mut self, performance: Performance) -> Adaptation;
}

pub struct DocumentSwarmCoordinator {
    swarm: SwarmCoordinator,

}

pub struct AgentCapability {
    pub domain: String,
    pub skills: Vec<Skill>,
    pub performance_history: PerformanceMetrics,
    pub learning_rate: f32,
}

    fn share_insights(&self) -> LearningInsights;
    fn integrate_learnings(&mut self, insights: Vec<LearningInsights>);
    fn update_strategy(&mut self, collective_knowledge: CollectiveKnowledge);
