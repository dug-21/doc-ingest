# Integration Test Fix Summary

## Overview
Fixed integration test imports and dependencies to match the actual crate structure in the neural document flow system.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. **Test File Imports Fixed**
- **integration_tests.rs**: Updated to use correct crate names (`neural_doc_flow`, `neural_doc_flow_coordination`, `neural_doc_flow_processors`) instead of non-existent `neuraldocflow`
- **neural_processing_tests.rs**: Updated imports to use the actual crate structure
- **daa_coordination_tests.rs**: Fixed imports for coordination types and functions
- **unit_tests.rs**: Updated to use correct module paths
- **property_tests.rs**: Rewritten with correct imports and property test structure

### 2. **Test Utilities Module**
- Created a simplified `test_utilities.rs` with commonly used test helpers:
  - `MockPdfGenerator` for creating test PDF data
  - `TestFileCreator` for temporary test files
  - `PerformanceTestUtils` for timing operations

### 3. **Fixtures Module**
- Simplified `fixtures/mod.rs` to provide test data generators without external dependencies

## Compilation Status

### ✅ Working Packages
- `neural-doc-flow-core`: All tests passing (6 tests)
- `neural-doc-flow-processors`: Tests passing (1 test)
- `neural-doc-flow-sources`: Compiles successfully

### ⚠️ Issues Remaining
- `neural-doc-flow-coordination`: Has compilation errors due to:
  - Missing `NeuralEngine` type imports
  - Type mismatches in agent implementations
  - Async trait issues with `DaaAgent`
  - Various lifetime and borrowing issues

### 🔧 Candle-core Dependency Issue
- The `candle-core` crate has compatibility issues with `half` crate types
- This affects neural processing features but doesn't block basic functionality

## Test Structure
```
tests/
├── integration_tests.rs     # Main integration tests (fixed)
├── neural_processing_tests.rs # Neural processing tests (fixed)
├── daa_coordination_tests.rs # DAA coordination tests (fixed)
├── unit_tests.rs           # Unit tests (fixed)
├── property_tests.rs       # Property-based tests (fixed)
├── test_utilities.rs       # Test helpers (created)
└── fixtures/
    └── mod.rs             # Test data fixtures (simplified)
```

## Next Steps

To fully fix all tests:

1. **Fix coordination module compilation errors**:
   - Add proper `NeuralEngine` type imports or create stubs
   - Fix async trait issues in `DaaAgent`
   - Resolve type mismatches in agent implementations

2. **Address candle-core compatibility**:
   - Either update candle-core version or disable features requiring `half` types
   - Consider using feature flags to conditionally compile neural features

3. **Create minimal stub implementations** for missing types if full implementation is not ready

## Running Tests

To run the working tests:
```bash
# Run core tests
cargo test --package neural-doc-flow-core --lib

# Run processor tests
cargo test --package neural-doc-flow-processors --lib

# Run source tests
cargo test --package neural-doc-flow-sources --lib

# Run main crate tests (may have some failures)
cargo test --lib
```

The test infrastructure is now in place with correct imports, allowing individual modules to be tested even if some parts of the system have compilation issues.
