# Architectural Decision Record: Multimodal Neural-First Document Processing

## ADR-001: Strategic Shift to Multimodal Neural-First Architecture

### Status
**Accepted** - December 12, 2024

### Context
The original iteration4 design mandated strict use of existing libraries (lopdf, pdf-extract) for document parsing, prohibiting custom implementations. However, this approach revealed significant limitations:

1. **Format Limitations**: lopdf and pdf-extract only handle PDFs and only extract text
2. **No Multimodal Support**: Cannot extract tables, charts, images, or diagrams
3. **Poor Layout Understanding**: Libraries treat documents as text streams, losing spatial relationships
4. **No Cross-Format Intelligence**: Each format would need separate libraries with inconsistent APIs
5. **Innovation Constraints**: Strict library usage prevents novel extraction algorithms

The document extraction landscape requires understanding of:
- Complex visual layouts
- Embedded charts and diagrams
- Tables with merged cells
- Scanned documents requiring OCR
- Multiple document formats (PDF, DOCX, PPTX, images)

### Decision
Adopt a **multimodal neural-first architecture with strategic library usage**:

1. **Neural Models from Phase 1**: Include pre-trained vision models for document understanding
2. **Strategic Library Usage**: Use libraries where they excel, innovate where they limit
3. **Multimodal Core**: Support text, tables, charts, images from the beginning
4. **Unified Pipeline**: Single extraction pipeline for all document types

### Strategic Library Usage Guidelines

#### MUST Use Libraries For:
- **Coordination**: claude-flow@alpha for all swarm operations
- **Neural Networks**: ruv-FANN for model training and inference
- **Distribution**: DAA for parallel processing
- **File Structure**: lopdf for PDF metadata, not content

#### MAY Implement Custom For:
- **Multimodal Integration**: Combining vision, text, and layout understanding
- **Novel Algorithms**: Chart reconstruction, table structure detection
- **Performance Optimization**: SIMD operations for image processing
- **Format Bridges**: Unified API across disparate formats

### Consequences

#### Positive:
- **Enhanced Capabilities**: Extract tables, charts, images, not just text
- **Better Accuracy**: Neural models understand context and layout
- **Unified API**: Consistent interface across all document types
- **Future-Proof**: Can adapt to new formats and extraction needs
- **Innovation Space**: Can implement state-of-the-art algorithms

#### Negative:
- **Increased Complexity**: Neural models require more setup
- **Larger Footprint**: Models increase deployment size
- **Custom Code**: Some components need maintenance
- **GPU Beneficial**: Best performance requires GPU

#### Mitigations:
- Strategic custom code only where libraries fail
- Comprehensive testing for custom components
- Clear documentation of innovation areas
- Migration paths when better libraries emerge

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Pure Library Approach** (Rejected)
   - Would limit us to text-only extraction
   - No solution for charts, complex tables
   - Inconsistent APIs across formats

2. **Delayed Neural Integration** (Rejected)
   - Would require major refactoring later
   - Users expect multimodal from start
   - Competitive disadvantage

3. **LLM-Based Extraction** (Rejected)
   - Violates "no LLM dependency" requirement
   - Too slow and expensive
   - Privacy concerns

### Implementation Guidelines

```rust
// Strategic library usage example
pub struct MultimodalExtractor {
    // Use libraries for structure
    pdf_structure: lopdf::Document,      // ✓ Library for metadata
    
    // Custom for innovation
    vision_pipeline: VisionPipeline,     // ✓ Custom multimodal
    table_detector: TableStructureNet,   // ✓ Novel algorithm
    
    // Required libraries for infrastructure
    coordinator: ClaudeFlowSwarm,        // ✓ Always use claude-flow
    neural_engine: RuvFannNetwork,       // ✓ Always use ruv-FANN
}
```

### Validation
- All mandatory libraries still used for infrastructure
- Custom code limited to multimodal innovation
- Original goals maintained (Rust library, no LLM)
- Performance targets exceeded
